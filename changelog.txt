Added some randomly-generated solveable 40-tile cases

(only the first actually solves)

Using a web worker to make the solve asynchronous

Needs to run in a webserver:

$ cd /mnt/devel/rummi
$ python3 -m http:server 9000

still working

started the cursor from the last non-joker added -- still works
about 8X faster on the 40-tile test case

Still opportunities with jokers (if two JS, will try one then the other!!)

version 10 -- decorative changes

version 11 -- change pool to an Int8Array.  Makes no performance difference!
